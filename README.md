### Hi there 👋

I'm Jingyi Ai ! 😉🎓 I am a PhD student in kinesiology working with Dr. Chang in Physical Activity and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at National Taiwan Normal University. Also, I am the EEGlab amateur！

I graduated with a BEng degree in kinesiology from Brijing Normal University (Beijing, China) in 2016. After that, I received a MSci degree from Nanjing Normal University (Nanjing, China) in 2019.

👀🔑 I’m currently working on cognition, especially executive function, by using behavior, R, Python, Matlab, EEG and computational models.

😅🔆 I enjoy a variety of sports, including, basketball, swimming, tennis, yoga, countless other sports, even extreme sports, scuba diving, etc.

📧📬 If you have any question about my projects, you can email me: aibb28165@gmail.com / 626014686@qq.com

😃💡 Research Interests: Cognition, Aging, Brain health.

😉👻 Current Focused Topics: The effect of exercise on cognition - How to high intensity intervel training effect on executive function? To investigate the effects of acute HIIT on P3 amplitude in older.

😵🔭 Future Goals: 1️⃣ Explore how brain encodes exercise information (basic exercise features, intensity, duration, type, time). 2️⃣ Make models to simulate how how brains encode exercise information, and to better decode the information our brains encode from brain activity.
